# Cardiac Pathology Prediction 

This repository contains my solution to the Kaggle challenge on **Cardiac Pathology Prediction** at Télécom Paris, aiming to classify patients into one of five diagnostic categories from cardiac MRI data and basic clinical information (height, weight).   

My approach combined thorough feature analysis with advanced machine learning techniques. I used a **nested cross-validation** strategy to select the best-performing models, and introduced a **two-stage classification refinement** to reduce specific misclassifications between closely related pathologies.  
I ranked **2nd out of 75 students** (with an accuracy of 0.94) at Télécom Paris for this challenge, organized as part of a course project.  

The repository includes:  
- A Jupyter notebook detailing my methodology and experiments  
- A report detailing my methodology, providing an analysis of the results and a discussion of possible improvements
